# WineMLApp

Hello! This is a ML web app that is built using python. I have always been interested in data science and so I decided to make an application for it!

I used the wine dataset from sk-learn. Not a wine drinker myself, but the data is solid. :) 

I used python libraries to predict the "class" of wine based on 13 parameters. You can play around with the app itself.

This is just the beginning of my ML journey. I hope to build more advanced apps in the future. Image recognition, I'm looking at you!
